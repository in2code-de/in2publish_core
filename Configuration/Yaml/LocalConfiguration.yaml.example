  # Set to TRUE to directly connect file relations to the page through the PID. This makes it impossible to control
  # publishing of content by the content element because the file reference will be published directly after the page

    # before disabling this option.

    #
    # IMPORTANT: If the UID of the foreign sys_file entry is already used in sys_file_reference this feature will not
    #   overwrite the foreign UID to prevent severe damage or missing images on the foreign's frontend.
